         Our story aims to investigate the situation of public spaces in Hong Kong: We will investigate and indicate in our story if they actually meet the requirements for POS’s, Public Open Spaces. 
<br> <br> 
According to the “Provision of public facilities in private developments”, every private development in Hong Kong should offer such a space, accessible to the public. However, there have been various complaints throughout the years, saying that a lot of Public Open Spaces are either nothing like the way they are described in the directory of Public Open Spaces on the Hong Kong government website (lacking in size for example), nowhere to be found or inaccessible to the public. There has never been a conclusive report on this matter though.
<br> <br> 
In short, this story seeks to discover if the public space situation in Hong Kong is really that worrying. To this end we will go to public spaces all over Hong Kong to get a fair representation of Public Open Spaces in Hong Kong. We will try to go everywhere from Central and Western district, to Sham Shui Po district, to Eastern district, etc. Hopefully this will allow us to assess the general situation and also to compare how the different districts are doing in Hong Kong, to see where improvement is needed.
<br> <br> 
We will take photos of all these public spaces and present these in our story, complemented with a critical analysis of whether the public spaces match their descriptions on the government website (whether they are big enough, in the right location, etc.) and whether they are actually accessible to the public. We plan to present our findings on our own website dedicated to this issue. Also, one of the multimedia components we want to incorporate into our story is a Google Fusion Map, to get a clear comparative overview of the different districts in Hong Kong.
<br> <br> 
One of our hypotheses is that “the more spacious” districts and areas in Hong Kong will do better in providing quality public spaces, since the fact that they are less heavily populated should logically mean they have more room to provide public spaces. Our story will investigate if this is indeed true.
